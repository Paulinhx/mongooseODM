## TASK 04 - MONGOOSE
In this task we will introduce Mongoose. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. We will learn how to setup Mongoose and how to connect it with our app. We will create our user models and schemas and define exactly how a record/user/order object will look.
TODO:
1.Please set up mongoose in your server. --DONE
2.Create a data schema and a model for our records, users and orders.
## TASK 05 - MONGOOSE AND CONTROLLERS

TODO:

2.Make sure all API endpoints for records work as they should.
